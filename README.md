cssanimationgenerator
=====================

Website that generates CSS and HTML code based on user input

This is my experiment on making a website that generates code samples using JQuery. You can see the working example at
http://animationcss.com. I have used the CSS and HTML generated by this website for the header animation of 
http://www.newtechtricks.com.

*It uses JQuery, HTML and CSS. 
*I used the fontpicker from  http://www.visualmedia.nl/html5/fontpicker/.
*Colorpicker from http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/. 
*To close, minimize and maximize the JQuery dialog, I used dialogextend.js from https://github.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend.
*I used ZeroClipboard from https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard to implement copy/paste functionality.
