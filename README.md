cssanimationgenerator
=====================

Website that generates CSS and HTML code based on user input

This is my experiment on making a website that generates code samples using JQuery. You can see the working example at
http://animationcss.com. I have used the CSS and HTML generated by this website for the header animation of 
http://www.newtechtricks.com.

It uses JQuery, HTML and CSS. I used the fontpicker from .... and colorpicker from http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ 
To close, minimize and maximize the JQuery dialog, I used dialogextend.js from 
https://github.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend.git
